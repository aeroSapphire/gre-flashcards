      correctAnswer: '8',
      explanation: 'Rate A = 1/12 job/day. Rate B = 1/15 job/day.\n\nPhase 1 — A alone for 3 days: 3 × (1/12) = 1/4 of the job done.\nRemaining = 3/4.\n\nPhase 2 — A+B together: Combined rate = 1/12 + 1/15 = 5/60 + 4/60 = 9/60 = 3/20.\nTime = (3/4) ÷ (3/20) = (3/4) × (20/3) = 5 days.\n\nTotal = 3 + 5 = 8 days.\n\nPattern: Any "X works alone, then they work together" problem is a two-phase problem — compute leftover, then divide by combined rate.',

      correctAnswer: [2],
      explanation: 'By 10:00 AM, Car A has a head start of 2 × 40 = 80 miles.\n\nSame direction → subtract speeds: relative speed = 60 − 40 = 20 mph.\nTime to close gap = 80/20 = 4 hours after 10 AM = 2:00 PM.\n\nDelayed Start Pattern: Compute the head start distance FIRST, then divide by relative speed.

Distances: 30−20 = 10 and 50−30 = 20. Ratio of quantities = inverse of distances = 20:10 = 2:1. So A:B = 2:1 out of 15 liters → A = 10, B = 5. Done in 5 seconds.',

      correctAnswer: [1],
      explanation: 'Alex rate = 1/6 room/hr.\n"50% faster" means Ben\'s RATE is 1.5 × (1/6) = 1/4 room/hr (Ben finishes in 4 hours).\n\nCombined = 1/6 + 1/4 = 2/12 + 3/12 = 5/12.\nTime = 12/5 = 2.4 hours.\n\nTHE key trap: "X% faster" means the RATE is multiplied by (1 + X/100). It does NOT mean time is reduced by X%. 50% faster rate ≠ 50% less time. Ben\'s time is 4 hours (33% less than 6, not 50% less).',

      correctAnswer: '122',
      explanation: 'Recursive sequences: just grind it out step by step.\n\na₁ = 2\na₂ = 3(2) − 1 = 5\na₃ = 3(5) − 1 = 14\na₄ = 3(14) − 1 = 41\na₅ = 3(41) − 1 = 122\n\nGRE recursive sequence problems NEVER require more than 5-6 iterations. Don\'t look for a closed-form formula — just compute carefully. The GRE tests arithmetic accuracy here, not pattern recognition.',

      content: 'A store marks up its wholesale price by 40%, then offers a 25% discount to customers. If a customer pays $84, what was the wholesale price in dollars?',
      correctAnswer: '80',
      explanation: 'Work BACKWARDS through successive percent changes.\n\nCustomer pays $84 = marked price × 0.75.\nMarked = 84/0.75 = $112.\n\nMarked = wholesale × 1.40.\nWholesale = 112/1.40 = $80.\n\nShortcut: Net multiplier = 1.40 × 0.75 = 1.05. So Wholesale × 1.05 = 84 → Wholesale = 84/1.05 = $80. One step.\n\nThe GRE loves markup-then-discount. Always multiply the individual multipliers to get the net multiplier.',
