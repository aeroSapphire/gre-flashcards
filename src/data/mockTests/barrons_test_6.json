In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.\n*Please write your response on separate pieces of paper.\nTASK 2: ARGUMENT ANALYSIS TIME: 30 MINUTES Your essay will be judged on the basis of your skill in the following areas:\n• identification and assessment of the argument’s main elements • organization and articulation of your thoughts • use of relevant examples and arguments to support your case • handling of the mechanics of standard written English\n\nTopic The following was written as part of a study weighing the benefits of a new construction project in the city of Winterville.\nCar racing is extremely popular in the city of Winterville: over 20,000 Winterville residents attended the state’s annual 500-lap race last summer, and the highest-rated television program in Winterville is “Race Talk,” which is broadcast every night. Also, many successful race-car drivers live in Winterville. However, the nearest racetrack is over 150 miles away from Winterville. Given the popularity of car racing in Winterville, and a recent report indicating that the average race fan spends close to $500 per year attending car races, a new racetrack in Winterville would be very profitable.\nDirections: Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted result. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.\n*Please write your response on separate pieces of paper.",

          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "(A) There are four single-digit prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, and 7. Try to get a feeling for the problem by writing down one or two numbers that meet the conditions described, such as 3,895 or 7,042. To count all such numbers, take a “fill-in-the-blank” approach. Use four blanks to represent the four digits of the number, and in each blank write the number of possible choices for the digit corresponding to that blank: __________ __________ __________ __________. Any of the four primes listed above may begin the number, but of these, only the digits 2 or 5 may end the number, to ensure that the number is divisible by 2 or 5. So we have combinations so far. There are no restrictions on the middle two digits of the number, so they can be any of the 10 digits, 0 through 9, in our base 10 system. The diagram becomes . The basic counting principle dictates that we multiply the number of possibilities at each juncture to obtain the total number of combinations. 4 × 10 × 10 × 2 = 800, (A)."

          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "(C) To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 111 and 141, you could divide each by various numbers on the calculator and look for common factors. Or you can shortcut the process by recalling the divisibility test for the number 3: if the sum of the digits of an integer is divisible by 3, then the integer itself is divisible by 3. 111 and 141 are both divisible by 3 because the sums 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 and 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 are both multiples of 3. Dividing 111 and 141 by 3 on the calculator shows that 111 = 37 × 3 and that 141 = 47 × 3. Since 37 and 47 are prime numbers with no additional factors in common, the GCF is 3. The easiest way to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 10 is to list multiples of the larger number until you reach one that is also a multiple of the smaller number: 10, 20, 30, 40. Since 40 equals 8 × 5, 40 is the LCM of 8 and 10. Then a = 3 and b = 40, so ab = 120, choice (C)."

          "explanation": "(B) In Questions 18 to 20, note that each box on the y-axis represents $2 million dollars, and so each half-box represents $1 million. For choice (A), the rice exports in 2000 were $24 million, which is close to $20 million for fruit + $6 million for wheat, but not roughly equal. For choice (B), the rice exports were between $26 million and $27 million, which is roughly equal to $19 million (fruit) + $8 million (wheat). For the other three choices, it should be easy to see at a glance that rice exports alone exceeded the sum of the other two exports. Imagine a vertical bar stretching up from the x-axis to each graph. For the 3 years listed in (C), (D), and (E), the rice bar is taller than the other two bars stacked end to end."

          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "(C) Save time by “counting boxes” to find the difference in value between rice and wheat exports, rather than finding each individual value. For example, in 2009 rice is 2.5 boxes above wheat, which represents 2.5 × $2 million = $5 million. Similarly, the 3.5 and 4.5 boxes that separate rice and wheat in 2010 and 2011, respectively, correspond to $7 million and $9 million. The total difference in export value for the 3-year period is then 5 + 7 + 9 = $21 million, (C)."

          "explanation": "(D) Scan along the fruit curve for years in which the value of exports decreased greatly from the year before. In 2006 and 2008, fruit exports dropped significantly—by two boxes, or $4 million—from the year before. In 2008, this $4 million decrease represented a larger percent change, because the change occurred from a lower starting value. Specifically, in 2008 the decrease was from the year before, while in 2006 the decrease was from the year before. (D) is correct."

          "explanation": "(12) The unknowns a and b can be thought of as two of the triangle’s side lengths. Because the x- and y-axes are perpendicular, the triangle is a right triangle and its area is given by , which is given as 6. Then ab = 6 × 2 = 12. Since a and b are integers, we can list all possible pairs of whole numbers for a and b whose product is twelve: (1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4). The length of the third side of the triangle is determined by the Pythagorean Theorem: a2 + b2 = c2, which implies . If c represents the remaining, unknown side length here, there are three possible values for c, one for each of the three pairs listed above. That is, . However, only the last, , is an integer as required, so c = 5, a = 3, and b = 4. This makes the perimeter 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. The values of a and b may be interchanged, but the perimeter is still 12."

          "explanation": "(492) When a list contains consecutive integers, use a simple but helpful formula for determining how many numbers there are from some first number, F, through some last number, L, inclusive. The formula is L – F + 1. Here, the 200 consecutive integers 1, 2, 3, … 200 are written on a page. Of these, there are nine single-digit numbers written, because 9 – 1 + 1 = 9 (using F = 1 and L = 9 in the formula). The two-digit numbers written include from 10 through 99, and thus include 99 – 10 + 1 = 90 numbers. The three-digit numbers written on the page include from 100 through 200, and thus include 200 – 100 + 1 = 101 whole numbers. So the total number of digits written is (9 × 1) + (90 × 2) + (101 × 3) = 9 + 180 + 303 = 492."

          "explanation": "(D) Let x = Jim’s age now. Then Ted is now x – 15 years old, since he is 15 years younger. 18 years ago, Jim was x – 18 years old, and Ted’s age was (x – 15) – 18 = x – 33. Since Jim was twice Ted’s age then, x – 18 = 2(x – 33), or x – 18 = 2x – 66. Subtract 1x and add 66 to each side, to obtain 48 = x, (D). *Let the ages now be J and T. Then the ages 18 years ago, the ages were J – 18 and T – 18. Set up one equation for present ages, J = T + 15, and one equation for past ages: J – 18 = 2(T – 18). Now substitute T + 15 for the J in the second equation: T + 15 – 18 = 2(T – 18). Therefore, T – 3 = 2T – 36. Finally, subtract T and add 36 to each side to find 33 = T.

          "explanation": "(D) Use the formula D = r × t, or distance = rate × time. When the second car leaves New York, the first car is ahead by miles. The second car travels faster by 66 – 54 = 12 miles per hour, meaning that it catches up by 12 miles every hour. Then by the D = rt formula again, 108 = 12 × t, and t = 9. This means that the second car will require 9 hours to close the distance of 108 miles. Since it departed at 2:00 (2 hours after 12:00), it reaches the first car at 2:00 + 9 hours = 11:00, (D)."

To find its area, first draw the altitude or height (call it h), and note that this divides the base into two congruent segments of length . By the Pythagorean Theorem, . Take the square root of each side to obtain . (You can also get h quickly by the pattern for side lengths of a 30–60–90 triangle, with s here set equal to .) Since the area of a triangle is given by  × base × height, the area here is . Set this equal to the perimeter: . Multiply by 4, and 12x = x2 . Since x ≠ 0, we can divide by x on both sides to obtain 12 = x . Divide by , and .
