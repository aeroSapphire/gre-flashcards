In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.\n*Please write your response on separate pieces of paper.\n\nTASK 2: ARGUMENT ANALYSIS TIME: 30 MINUTES Your essay will be judged on the basis of your skill in the following areas:\n• identification and assessment of the argument’s main elements • organization and articulation of your thoughts • use of relevant examples and arguments to support your case • handling of the mechanics of standard written English Topic Our school is the best choice for students considering a career in theatre.\nFirst, our school does not require an audition and encourages applicants of all acting experience levels to apply. Second, our students are trained in all major schools of acting methods. Finally, many of our graduates have gone on to achieve acting roles in Broadway productions and Hollywood films.\nDirections: Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be addressed in order to decide whether the conclusion and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to the questions would help to evaluate the conclusion.\n*Please write your response on separate pieces of paper.",

After four values have been crossed off either end, 9 and 11 remain in the middle, making the median equal to = 10.

          "explanation": "(C) First, since the triangle is isosceles, two side lengths are equal, and two angles are equal. The value of the two equal angles is . Next, draw the perpendicular from the upper vertex to the base, creating two congruent 30–60–90 triangles, each with base . If you remember the s – s – 2s pattern for the side lengths of 30–60–90 triangles, you can quickly obtain 6, 6 , and 12 as the three side lengths, meaning that x = 6 and 2x = 12 in the diagram. This makes the perimeter of the original isosceles triangle 12 + 12 + 12 = 24 + 12 , (C). If you forget the formula for 30–60–90 triangles, draw the dashed reference lines, and observe that the symmetry of the larger equilateral triangle thus created implies the 1x to 2x ratio of side lengths in the upper right triangle. Then, from the Pythagorean Theorem, x2 + (6 )2 = (2x)2. So x2 + 36 × 3 = 4x2, which yields 108 = 3x2 and 36 = x2. This again makes x = 6 and perimeter equal to 4x + 12 = 24 + 12 ."

          "explanation": "(D) Call the uniform width x, and the outer dimensions of the picture together with the frame become 8 + 2x and 12 + 2x, because the frame’s width adds to both the top and bottom and the left and right of the picture. The full area of the picture together with frame is then (8 + 2x) (12 + 2x) = 96 + 16x + 24x + 4x2 = 4x2 + 40x + 96. This expression must equal 2 × 8 × 12 = 192, because the frame’s area is equal to the picture’s, implying that the area enclosed by the frame and picture together must equal twice the area of the picture alone. So 4x2 + 40x + 96 = 192. Subtract 192 to obtain 4x2 + 40x – 96 = 0, and divide by 4 on both sides: x2 + 10x – 24 = 0. The left side factors as (x + 12)(x – 2), since 12x – 2x = 10x, and so x = 2 or –12. Only x = 2, (D), works in context of the problem, because a length cannot be negative. You can also get this result using a trial and error approach with the answer choices. When x = 2, the outer dimensions become 12 × 16, for a total area of 192. This makes the picture’s area, 8 × 12 = 96, the same as the frame’s area, 192 – 96 = 96."

          "explanation": "(12) Since the ratio is 1:2:3:4, we can think of the jars containing 1x, 2x, 3x, and 4x marbles for some whole number, x. Then 1x + 2x + 3x + 4x = 60, so 10x = 60, and x = 6. This makes the current count of marbles in the jars 1(6), 2(6), 3(6), and 4(6), or 6, 12, 18, and 24. If each jar were to contain 60 ÷ 4 = 15 marbles, the ratio would become 15 : 15 : 15 : 15, which reduces to 1:1:1:1, as required. The minimum number of stones that must be moved to effect this change is 3 + 9 = 12, because three stones moved from the 18 jar to the 12 jar would leave those jars with 15 stones each, and nine stones moved from the 24 jar to the 6 jar would give those jars 15 each."

Think of this situation as 3 raised to some power must equal 729, and use trial and error on your calculator to obtain the proper exponent. You might worry that this will take too long, but exponential functions grow quickly, and in a few seconds you should obtain 729 = 81 × 9 = 34 × 32 = 36. This means that x + y + z = 6. Observe that 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. For three unalike positive integers, this is the only solution, since all other such sums will be greater than 6. Given z = x + y, then z is 3, and x and y are 1 and 2 in either order. Finally, 3z = 33 = 27. 8. The volume of cup B when full is twice that of cup A, so it is natural to represent these quantities as 2x and x. But the question asks about cup B, so it is easier to let x = the volume of cup B, and let  x = the volume of cup A (when full). Since A is now  full, it contains units of fluid or other contents. This  x is to be added to the  x currently in cup B. Add the fractions by using the common denominator: 9 × 8 = 72. Then , meaning the cup is full."

          "explanation": "(A) For each answer choice, get zero on one side first. For example, (A) becomes x2 + 8x + 17 = 0. You can determine the number of real solutions by considering the discriminant, b2 – 4ac, from the Quadratic Formula. Here, a = 1, b = 8, and c = 17. Then b2 – 4ac = 82 – 4 × 1 × 17 = 64 – 68 = –4. When the discriminant is negative, there are no solutions, since it is not possible to take the square root of a negative number within the real number system. (The discriminant appears under the radical sign in the Quadratic Formula: .) Only (A) makes b2 – 4ac negative. Graph the equation y = x2 + 8x in the xy-plane. First, find the x- intercepts by setting y equal to zero. So 0 = x2 + 8x = x(x + 8), and x = 0 or –8. Due to the symmetry of the parabola, the vertex will occur halfway between x = 0 and x = –8, meaning that x = is the graph’s axis of symmetry. Plug x = –4 into y = x2 + 8x, and y = (–4)2 + 8(–4) = 16 – 32 = –16. This means that the vertex has coordinates (–4, –16). The y-coordinate of the vertex in an upward pointed parabola is the graph’s minimum value. Because –17 < –16, y can never equal –17, and (A) is correct. *If you are stuck, you may be able to guess the correct answer by reasoning that x2 is usually “big,” because it is both non-negative and generally greater than a linear term, such as 8x. So x2 + 8x will probably not be as small as the smallest answer choice, –17, (A)."
