In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.\n*Please write your response on separate pieces of paper.\nTASK 2: ARGUMENT ANALYSIS TIME: 30 MINUTES Your essay will be judged on the basis of your skill in the following areas:\n•   identification and assessment of the argument’s main elements •   organization and articulation of your thoughts •   use of relevant examples and arguments to support your case •   handling of the mechanics of standard written English Topic",

          "explanation": "(24) Three consecutive even integers can be represented by x, x + 2, and x + 4. Set the sum of these side lengths equal to the perimeter: x + x + 2 + x + 4 = 24. Combining like terms yields 3x + 6 = 24. Subtract 6 from both sides, and 3x = 18, so x = 6. This means that the three side lengths are 6, 8, and 10, which you can also obtain with a guess-and-check approach, since 4 + 6 + 8 equals only 18, but 6 + 8 + 10 = 24. If we knew that this were a right triangle, we could treat 8 as the base and 6 as the height, and the triangle’s area, given by  × base × height, would equal  × 6 × 8 = 24. We can verify that the triangle is, in fact, right by noting that 62 + 82 = 102 (since 36 + 64 = 100), which means that the side lengths satisfy the Pythagorean relationship a2 + b2 = c2. Then the area is 24, by coincidence matching the perimeter."

When the trees’ heights are equal, the y values in each equation will be equal, so we can set 3.6x + 76 equal to 4.8x + 58.

So at least one of the unknown scores must equal 76. The median, or middle value on a list, is found by first rewriting the given numbers in order from least to greatest. Here, after inserting the second 76, we know these 6 scores: 35, 48, 76, 76, 89. Since the median is given as 54, draw a triangle below the 54, and think of that as the balancing point. There are three values to the right of the triangle but only two to the left. Therefore, the final missing score must be less than 54, to ensure that 54 is in the middle. Only choice (A), 50, works. Thus, the two missing scores are 50 and 76, and since the problem asks for the smaller of these, (A) is correct."

When a 1- cm margin is painted around the edge of the paper, the length and width of the unpainted region are each reduced by 2 cm, because the paint covers both the top and bottom of the page, as well as the left and right of the page. Therefore, the unpainted region now measures (12 − 2) by (20 − 2), or 10 by 18, and its area is 10 × 18 = 180 cm2. This means that or 75% remains unpainted, (E)."

          "explanation": "(C) Be careful. The total number of employees increases from 80 million to 120 million between 2011 and 2050, so a decrease in percentage for a category could correspond to an increase in actual workers. For example, the service sector in 2011 contains 20% of 80 million employees, which is 16 million employees, while in 2050, the percentage drops to 16.67%, but .1667 × 120 million ≈ 20 million employees, a net increase. In addition to the service sector, the health, technology, and education sectors also see an increase in the number of employees (a higher percentage of a higher total), so there are four such categories in all, (C)."

This yields 2x − 3 = x2 − 6x + 9. To solve a quadratic, or x2, equation, set one side equal to zero first, by grouping all the terms onto the other side. Here, subtract 2x and add 3 to both sides to obtain: 0 = x2 − 8x + 12. Finally, factor the right side by noting that −6 × −2 equals 12, while −6 + −2 = −8. So 0 = (x − 2)(x − 6), and x = 2 or x = 6. However, squaring both sides may produce an “extraneous” solution, so make sure to check each result in the original equation. If x = 2, the right side equals but the left equals 2 − 3 = −1. Only x = 6 satisfies the original equation, making both sides equal to 3."

Observe that 81 = 9 × 9, and that 9 = 3 × 3, so that 81 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 34, so x = 3 satisfies the first equation. Next, solve for y by dividing both sides of the second equation by 8 to obtain y3 = 8, and y = 2 (since 2 × 2 × 2 = 8). It may seem that if x = 3 and y = 2, then (A) is greater, but recall that a negative number raised to an even power is positive. Here, (−3)4 also equals 81, so x could equal 3 or −3. Since 3 > 2, but −3 < 2, (D) is correct."

Begin with the vertex, an important point on a parabola, given here by the coordinates (1, −2). If the equation of the parabola is g(x), then g(1) must equal −2. In choice (B), g(1) = (1 − 1)2 − 2 = 0 − 2 = −2. No other choice contains a function such that g(1) = −2. *The function given in choice (B), g(x) = (x − 1)2 − 2, represents a transformation of the common function, f(x) = x2, whose graph in the xy- plane is a parabola pointed upward with vertex at the origin (0, 0,). Replacing x with (x − 1) causes a horizontal translation 1 unit to the right, and subtracting 2 causes a vertical translation 2 units down. Since the graph depicted has been shifted 1 unit to the right and 2 units down from the origin, (B) is correct."

Here, each standard deviation equals 8 kg, so 1 to 2 standard deviations correspond to 8 to 16 kg. Pythons weighing from 8 to 16 kg from the mean of 110, would have weights in either the interval 94 to 102, if they are below average, or in the interval 118 to 126, if they are above average.

Initially we have If we add x blue marbles, this will add to the number of blue and to the total, so P(blue) becomes Set this result equal to the desired probability and then cross-multiply: So 9(40 + x) = 7(120 + x). Distribute on both sides, and 360 + 9x = 840 + 7x. Combine like terms by subtracting 7x and 360 from both sides to obtain 2x = 480. Divide by 2, and x = 240. 14. The number of male students at the school is 60% of 25, or .60 × 25 = 15. Of these 15 males, 40% are male transfer students. So there are .4 × 15 = 6 male transfer students. To find the probability that two randomly selected students will be in this group of six out of 25, we can reason, “The first student selected must be a male transfer AND the second student must be a male transfer.” The AND requires you to multiply the two probabilities. The first probability is simply but if one male transfer student is selected, there will be only five such students remaining to choose from, out of 24 students in all. Then the second probability is and the probability of both students being in this group is You can find the product on your calculator, or perhaps faster by hand by cross-canceling: reduce 6 with 24 and 5 with 25 to obtain or .05."
