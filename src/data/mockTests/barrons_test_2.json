When the teacher adds 10 points to every score, the scores and their average are all shifted upward by 10, but the spread of the test scores from their mean remains unchanged. Therefore, the standard deviation of the new set is the same as that of the original set, and (C) is correct. To compute an actual standard deviation will not be required on the GRE.

          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "(A) The probability of any event is always between zero and one, inclusive, which means that 0 ≤ p ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ s ≤ 1. Recall that the product of two decimals between 0 and 1 is smaller than either one of them (“fraction of a fraction”) and that the sum of any two positive numbers is greater than either one of them. This suggests that Quantity (A), p + s, is greater than Quantity (B), ps. Choice (A) is correct, but don’t forget to check the boundary cases, because p or s could equal 0 or 1, when some of these general rules do not apply. If p equals 1, then p + s equals 1 + s, while ps equals 1s. Since 1 + s > s, (A) is greater. If p = 0, then p + s = s, while ps = 0, and again (A) is greater. *Pick plausible values for p and s, consistent with the fact that p and s represent probabilities, and test each pair. For example, if and then p + s equals 1, while ps equals and (A) is greater. If p = .1 and s = .1, then p + s equals .2, which is much greater than ps, or .01. Finally, if p = s = .9 or .8, then p + s > 1, while ps < 1, confirming that Quantity (A) is greater. By testing a wide range of possible values for p and s, we are fairly certain that (A) will always be greater."

For example, if w = 1, x = 2, and y = 3, then Quantity (A), 100 − y, equals 97, while Quantity (B), y − w, equals only 2. But if w = 10, x = 20, and y = 99, then Quantity (A) equals only 1, while Quantity (B) equals 89. Therefore, there is not enough information to determine, and (D) is correct."

          "explanation": "(A) In the second sentence given, there is one fewer hot dog but one more pretzel. Replacing one hot dog with one pretzel decreases the total cost, so the pretzel must be cheaper. Then the cost of the hot dog, Quantity (A), is greater. *Represent the information with a linear system. If x is the price of one hot dog and y is the price of one pretzel, then 10x + 9y = 74.15, and 9x + 10y = 74.05. Try lining up the equations vertically and subtracting to find some type of cancellation. Adding y to each side reveals that x = y + .10, so the cost of the hot dog is $.10 more than the cost of the pretzel, and (A) is greater. *The on-screen calculator makes the traditional elimination method possible, but since this approach is much longer, try to spot one of the easier ways first. Set up a linear system, as in (*) above. Then multiply the first equation by 9 and the second equation by −10, so that the x coefficients become equal but opposite in sign. Some number crunching shows that Add the two whole equations together to obtain −19y = −73.15. Dividing both sides by −19 shows that y = $3.85. Finally, substitute this value back into one of the original equations and solve for x, to obtain x = $3.95, and (A) is greater."

Now subtract 4x from each side, and add x2 to each side, in order to combine like terms and to get one side equal to zero. Then 0 = x2 − 7x + 6. Factor the right side by noting that (x − 6)(x − 1) = x2 − 1x − 6x + 6 = x2 − 7x + 6. So (x − 6)(x − 1) = 0 and x could equal 6 or 1, the values that make either expression in parentheses equal to 0.

If a point 3 units from the center lies inside the circle, while a point 5 units from the center lies outside the circle, then the radius of the circle is between 3 and 5 and must equal 4, since the radius is given as an integer.

Then the pool went from 12% full at 12:00 to 28% full at 2:30. The increase is 28% − 12% = 16% of the pool’s full volume in 2.5 hours. During this time, the pool was filled at a rate of 2 gallons per minute. We must convert 2.5 hours into 2.5 × 60 = 150 minutes, in order to find that gallons. This means that 300 gallons were added and that 300 gallons represents 16% of the pool’s total volume, say T. Then 300 = .16T. Divide both sides by .16, and T equals 300 ÷ .16 = 1875, (A)."

Strategy note: most students would benefit by skipping this challenging question and using their time on several easier ones in the section. The area of the square is 256, so the length of one side is 16, the square root of 256. Since the square is centered at (0,0), half the square’s length, 8, will extend to the right of the origin. Similarly, the square will extend 8 units to the left, above, and below the origin. Then the square’s “top right corner point,” or vertex in Quadrant I, has coordinates (8,8). If this is also a point on the graph of f(x) = cx3, then f(8) = 8, meaning that we can substitute (8,8) as x and y values into the function and solve for the unknown constant, c. Then 8 = c83, and"

Divide all three parts of this inequality by 1.09 to obtain $13.76 < b < $18.35. This result implies both (A) and (B), because b is certainly greater than $13.50 but less than $18.50. Choice (C) is not true, because if the marked price were $18, for example, then the sales tax would have been .09 × $18 = $1.62, which is greater than $1.50, while the total price remains low enough, $19.62, to leave John change, as required.",

For example, 5 + 3 = 8. Subtracting two odd integers yields an even integer, so (B) is not correct. For example, 5 − 3 = 2. (C) is correct because multiplying any two odd integers always results in another odd integer—for example, 3 × −9 = −27, and 7 × 11 = 77. This is because when neither number has 2 as a factor, the product will not have 2 as a factor (since 2 is a prime number). (D) is not correct, because dividing two elements from Set S will often produce a non-integer value. For example, 5 ÷ 3 ≈ 1.67. Finally, (E) is correct, because raising an odd number to any power will yield an odd result for basically the same reasons as (C) above. Repeated multiplication by the same odd number continues to yield products that lack 2 as a factor and are thus, by definition, odd. For example, 31 = 3, 32 = 9, 33 = 27, 34 = 81.

          "explanation": "(D, E) If there were an equal number of boys and girls, then the class average would equal the average of 78 and 94, which is But since there are more boys in the class, the average is weighted toward their number, 78, and will be less than 86. So choices (A) and (B) may be eliminated. If there are at least 3 times as many boys, then the class average will be at least 3 times as close numerically to their average as to the girls’ average. To find this value, which will be the maximum average for the class, we find the number  of the way from the boys’ average to the girls’ in order to obtain a 1:3 ratio of lengths. First, find the difference in the two averages, 94 − 78 = 16, and then divide this by 4 to obtain 16 ÷ 4 = 4. This number, 4, is added to 78, to obtain 82, the value 4 units from the boys’ average and 94 − 82 = 12 units from the girls’ average, which creates a 4:12 or 1:3 ratio of distances on the number line. This means that “at least three times as many boys” implies that the class average is at most 82, and (D) and (E) are correct. (This is sometimes thought of as the leverage or “see-saw” principle. On a see-saw, a 100- pound boy must sit 3 feet from the fulcrum to balance a 150-pound boy sitting 2 feet from the fulcrum, because 100 × 3 = 150 × 2.)"

Notice that 2 appears squared in this expression, but that 3 and 5 appear to the first power. For a number to be the square of another integer, each prime in the prime factorization of the number must be raised to an even power. (A) is not correct, because 228 × 60 will equal 230 × 3 × 5, which cannot be the square of an integer, because 3 and 5 are still to the first power.
