Then two angles in the lower triangle are known, so we can subtract their sum from 180 to find the third angle. 180 – (48 + 95) = 37°. Both the top angle of the lower triangle and the bottom angle of the upper triangle become 37°, because when two lines intersect, the angles directly across from each other, “vertical angles,” are equal.

So 2x2 − 9x − 18 = (x − 6) (________ + ________).

If she spent an equal amount on food plus rent as on expenses plus savings, then expenses plus savings must account for exactly  of all spending. This means that 2x + 1x = , as long as x represents the proportion of spending on savings. Then 3x = , and multiplying by  on each side yields x = . In other words, x =  of Ann’s spending was on savings, and therefore was for expenses. One-third of the total $4,080 is 4,080 ÷ 3 = $1,360."

The four sectors are congruent, so the four central angles at point C are all equal, and thus each measures one-fourth of 360°. (Since there are 360° in a circle.) That is, angle ACB measures  × 360° = 90°. Then triangle ACB is an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90 triangle), the side lengths of which are always in the ratio x:x:x . This means that the length of hypotenuse AB equals the leg length times , which equals 6 , (B). If you don’t have the formula for the 45-45-90 triangle memorized, you can also obtain the last result from the Pythagorean Theorem: 62 + 62 = 36 + 36 = 72 = c2, and"

In the following year, it increased in value by 22% of this, or .22 × $64,020 = $14,084.40. When this increase is added to 64,020, the final value becomes $78104.4, which rounds to $78,104. *A nice shortcut is to think of the final value as 1.22(.97(66,000)), which is entered on the calculator as 1.22 × .97 × 66,000 = 78,104.4 ≈ 78,104. In this approach, we obtain 1.22 mentally by thinking of (value + 22% of value) as 1V + .22V = 1.22V. Similarly, value minus 3% of value is 1V – .03V = .97V, justifying the shortcut."

          "explanation": "(A, B) For (A), it is easiest to imagine that the company started with sales of $100. After a 10% increase, it had sales of 100 + 10 = $110. When the company next experienced a 10% decrease in sales, it lost .10 × 110 = $11 in sales, so it had only $110 – 11 = $99 in sales. (Or .9 × 110 = $99, as in 16* above.) This makes (A) correct, because 99 < 100, corresponding to a decrease in sales from the starting value. To compute Company B’s change in sales for the 2-year period, multiply 1.12 by 1.13 to represent the 12% increase “on top of” a 13% increase (again, see 16* above). This yields 1.12 × 1.13 ≈ 1.266, or about a 26.6% increase for the 2-year period. Inspection of the other numbers shows that none of the other companies increased by as much, so (B) is correct. You can use the percent change figures to compute Company C’s total sales ratio for 2011 to 2009. Assume the figure is $100 in 2009. After a 17% increase, the sales will equal $117. However, to decrease this number, $117, by 5% is not to simply subtract 5 from 117, to obtain 112, and so the ratio will not equal 112:100, and (C) is not correct. Company C’s sales in 2011 in this example would equal .95 × 117 = 111.15, and so the proper ratio of sales between the two years would be 111.15:100. Answer is (A) and (B).",

The area of a trapezoid is given by where b1 and b2 are the bases (the parallel sides) and h is the height, or perpendicular altitude drawn between the bases. Here, This means that 12 × h = 48, since the trapezoid’s area equals that of the rectangle, and h = 4. Finally, the symmetry of the isosceles trapezoid and the central rectangle allow us to infer that XY, in the figure below, is equal to 9, and that PX and YQ are both equal to Then QR is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to 3 and 4, so QR = 5, by the Pythagorean Theorem, because 32 + 42 = 52. If you forget the formula for area of a trapezoid, you can also find h by setting the sum of the areas of the rectangle and two right triangles in the figure above equal to the known area of 48.

To solve, take a “fill in the blank” approach. Write out five blanks to represent the five weekdays, say Monday through Friday:_____ _____ _____ _____ _____. In each blank, write the number of ways that particular blank can be filled. On Monday, there are five possible games we could test, so write 5 in the first blank. On Tuesday, there are only four choices left, because the same game will not be tested again. Since five different games need to be tested in the 5-day period, repeats are precluded. Write 4 in the second blank. On Wednesday, there are only three choices remaining, and so forth. By the Basic Counting Principle, the total number of combinations equals the product of these numbers.

          "explanation": "(D) Conveniently, the numbers are already in (decreasing) numerical order, making it easy to compute the median. The median annual total enrollment through 2006 is simply 828, the number in the middle. If the new value, the 2007 total enrollment, were less than 828, the median would go down and would not equal 834.5, as required. If the 2007 total were more than 850, then the median for the 8 years would be the average of the two middle values, and again would not equal 834.5. Therefore, the 2007 total enrollment, say x, must have been between 828 and 850, and more importantly, when x is averaged with 828, the result is the median for all 8 years, 834.5. This means So 828 + x = 1,669. Then x = 1,669 – 828 = 841. Finally, 300 of these 841 students were female, leaving 841 – 300 = 541 males, (D)."

          "explanation": "(A) The segment whose endpoints are the centers of the two circles will have a length of 3 + 4 = 7, because the segment consists of the radii of the two circles meeting endpoint to endpoint on a straight line. Since the circles are tangent to the x-axis (intersecting at exactly one point), the radius of each circle, when drawn to the x-axis, will be perpendicular to the x-axis and will determine the center’s y-coordinate. That is, one circle’s center is 3 units above the x-axis, and one center is 4 units above the x–axis. Then for some constants, c and d, we can think of the coordinates of the two centers as (c,3) and (d,4). To find the slope of the segment, find change in y over change in x, or We can infer that d – c is less than 7, because it represents the length of the horizontal leg of the right triangle depicted, which must be less than the length of the triangle’s hypotenuse, 7. (Specifically, Then so (A) is greater. For positive values, a larger number in the denominator makes the fraction smaller."
