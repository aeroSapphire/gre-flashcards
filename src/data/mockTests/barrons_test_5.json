Others believe such comforts are indicative of a society’s self-sufficiency.\nDirections: Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both the views presented.\n*Please write your response on separate pieces of paper.\n\nTASK 2: ARGUMENT ANALYSIS TIME: 30 MINUTES Your essay will be judged on the basis of your skill in the following areas:\n• identification and assessment of the argument’s main elements • organization and articulation of your thoughts • use of relevant examples and arguments to support your case • handling of the mechanics of standard written English Topic In a study of the music listening preferences of Hollyland residents, conducted by the University of Sunnyland, most respondents listed their favorite type of music as country. However, another study indicated that, in Hollyland, the most frequently downloaded songs were all in the popular music genre. Therefore, it can be assumed that the respondents in the initial study were not truthful about their music listening habits.\nDirections: Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.\n*Please write your response on separate pieces of paper.",

The area of this rectangle equals twice the area of the original equilateral triangle and thus represents Quantity (B). This is because if PQ were drawn, the two exterior triangles could be paired with two congruent interior triangles. The rectangle has the same height as the square but a lesser width. So its area is less than that of the square, and (A) is greater. *Let x equal the length of each side in the figure. The area of the square (A), is x2. Compute the area of the equilateral triangle by first drawing the dotted altitude, h, which will be used as the height, along with base x, to find the triangle’s area = . This altitude, h, creates a 30-60-90 triangle, and if you remember the s – s – 2s pattern for the side lengths of these special triangles, you can quickly obtain . (Or find h by the Pythagorean Theorem.) Then the area of the original triangle is Twice this is which is less than 1x2, because Then (A), x2, is greater."

          "explanation": "(160 ml) The nurse uses 120 ml of the 8% solution, which must contain 120 × .08 = 9.6 ml of acid. Let x = the volume of 15% solution that he or she uses. When the solutions are combined, there will be 120 + x total solution, of which 9.6 + .15x is acid. Since the combined solution is meant to have a 12% concentration, 12% of the total must equal the acid volume. That is, .12(120 + x) = 9.6 + .15x. Then 14.4 + .12x = 9.6 + .15x. Combine like terms by subtracting 9.6 and .12x from each side: 4.8 = .03x. Finally, divide by .03 on each side to obtain 160 ml = x."

In other words, $3.75 is the price per shirt. So when 995 – 775 = 220 more shirts are bought, the cost differential is 3.75 × 220 = $825. *The cost of 995 shirts is c(995) = 3.75(995) + 180 = $3,911.25. The cost of 775 shirts is c(775) = 3.75(775) + 180 = $3,086.25. The difference is 3,911.25 − 3,086.25 = $825."

Then, the combined sum of test scores for the entire class is 1,260 + 960 = 2,220 points.

The ratio of 18 boys to 12 girls is thus reduced to 3:2. For three boys at 70 points per boy, there are 3 × 70 = 210 total points.

The product is 0 when either factor is 0, so –10t = 0 or t – 4 = 0, and t = 0 or t = 4.

Substituting these into the original equation, we obtain (22)x2 = (23)2x. The “power to a power” rule dictates that exponents are multiplied here, so 22x2 = 26x. Since both sides have the common base of 2, we can set the exponents equal. Then 2x2 = 6x, and 2x2 – 6x = 0. Take out the common factor, and 2x(x – 3) = 0, implying that 2x = 0 or x – 3 = 0.

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "(B) To compute these probabilities directly is beyond the scope of this book or the timeframe of the GRE. Treat this as a concept question. If the probability of heads is , we expect  of the 24 tosses to result in heads. The actual number of heads will vary if this experiment is repeated, but since  × 24 = 12, the result of 12 heads will be the most probable single outcome and will represent the long-term average number of heads. (B). While choice (E) represents three distinct outcomes—22 heads, 23 heads, or 24 heads—it is extremely unlikely to obtain that many heads on 24 tosses, as these numbers are remote from the mean of 12. *A reader familiar with Pascal’s Triangle may be aware that the values in the triangle can be used to find the values of nCr, the “choose function” for obtaining the number of combinations when r objects are chosen from n. For example, in the small portion of Pascal’s Triangle above, the six numbers in the bottom line represent 5C0, 5C1, 5C2, 5C3, 5C4, and 5C5, in order. In Pascal’s Triangle, the largest values always occur in the middle of each line, which implies that 24C12 is greater than 24Cn, for any value of n other than 12, so (B) is correct. In other words, imagine 24 blanks to represent the 24 outcomes of the coin flips. There are more ways to distribute 12 heads among the blanks than, say, 10 heads or 13 heads, because 24C12 is greater than either 24C10 or 24C13. Infer the last fact from the symmetry of Pascal’s Triangle rather than direct computation, because of the time limit. Elsewhere in the book, nCr is formally defined and used to obtain the number of combinations."
