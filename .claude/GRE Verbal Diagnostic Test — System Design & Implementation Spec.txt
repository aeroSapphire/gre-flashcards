# GRE Verbal Diagnostic Test — System Design & Implementation Spec

## Purpose
Design and implement a **GRE-style diagnostic test** whose sole purpose is to determine a user’s **current verbal skill profile** and **starting position in the curriculum spine**.  
This diagnostic is **not** a score predictor and **not** a practice set.

The diagnostic must expose **systematic weaknesses**, not maximize realism.

---

## Core Design Philosophy
- Designed like a real GRE tutor’s intake assessment
- Over-samples trap types and cognitive failure modes
- Slightly harder than average GRE practice
- Optimized for **mistake classification**, not user confidence
- Uses existing GRE-style question formats (TC, SE, RC)

---

## Test Length & Structure
- Total questions: **35–45**
- Expected duration: **45–60 minutes**
- Timing:
  - No hard time limit
  - Suggested time shown per question
  - Time spent per question must be logged

---

## Skill Categories Covered (Non-Negotiable)

Each diagnostic question must target **exactly one primary skill category**.

| Skill Category | Primary Question Types | Target Count | Primary Failure Signals |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Polarity & Direction | TC, SE | 8–10 | POLARITY_ERROR |
| Intensity & Precision | SE, TC | 8–10 | INTENSITY_MISMATCH, PARTIAL_SYNONYM_TRAP |
| Scope & Logic | TC, RC | 8–10 | SCOPE_ERROR, CONTEXT_MISREAD, LOGICAL_CONTRADICTION |
| Elimination Skill | Mixed | 6–8 | ELIMINATION_FAILURE |
| Mixed Stress & Switching | Mixed | 5–7 | Combined / fatigue errors |

This is intentionally **not** a balanced GRE section.

---

## Difficulty Profile
- ~60% Medium–Hard
- ~30% Hard
- ~10% Brutal (designed to fail)

Failure under pressure is diagnostically valuable.

## Diagnostic Question Blueprint

Each diagnostic question must be created from a blueprint with the following fields:

```ts
type DiagnosticQuestionBlueprint = {
  questionType: "TC" | "SE" | "RC"
  difficulty: "MEDIUM" | "HARD" | "BRUTAL"
  primarySkill: SkillCategory
  intendedTrap: string
  expectedMistakeLabel: MistakeLabel
  greRealismNotes: string
}
```

## Rules
- Each question has one primary skill
- Each wrong option must map to a plausible GRE mistake
- Correct answers should be unambiguous after reasoning

# Diagnostic Assembly Logic

## Composition Rules
- Fixed blueprint mix for all users
- No adaptive ordering during the test
- Questions ordered to:
	- Start manageable
        - Increase logical density
	- End with mixed stress and switching

## Assembly output
```ts
type DiagnosticTest = {
  questions: DiagnosticQuestion[]
  totalQuestions: number
}
```

## Integration with mistake classifier
For each answered question:
- Run the deterministic GRE Verbal Mistake Classifier
- Store:
	- mistake label

	- question type

	- timestamp

	- time spent

**Correct answers must be labeled as NONE.

# Diagnostic Result Analysis (Critical)

## Inputs
- Mistake label distribution

- Recency-weighted counts

- Time spent per question

- Question type breakdown

## Outputs
```ts
type DiagnosticResult = {
  dominantMistake: MistakeLabel | null
  secondaryMistake: MistakeLabel | null
  startingLearningPhase: LearningPhase
  confidenceFlags: {
    falseConfidence: boolean
    timePressureSensitivity: boolean
  }
}
```

## Rules
- ignore raw score
- use patterns, not total
- require minimum data thresholds before conclusions

# Mapping to Learning phases

The diagnostic must determine the user's initial **LearningPhase**:

- CALIBRATION (default if data is sparse)

- POLARITY_MASTERY

- INTENSITY_PRECISION

- SCOPE_AND_LOGIC

- ELIMINATION_UNDER_PRESSURE

- MIXED_READINESS

The earliest phase with dominant mistakes wins.


# User-facing Diagnostic Completion Output

## Constraints
- No numerical score emphasis

- No percentile comparisons

- No discouraging language

## Required Output

- One-paragraph summary of how the user currently fails

- One primary focus area

- One concrete next step

Tone: calm, tutor-like, confident, precise


# Safeguards & Retakes

- Diagnostic cannot be retaken within a short cooldown period
- Partial diagnostics must be flagged as incomplete
- Diagnostic questions must never appear in normal practice pools

# Explicit Non-Goals

- This diagnostic does NOT predict GRE score
- This diagnostic does NOT replace full-length tests
- This diagnostic does NOT adapt mid-test

# Success Criteria

- Diagnostic reliably triggers dominant mistake labels
- Starting LearningPhase aligns with observed behavior
- Users report clarity, not discouragement
- Downstream curriculum recommendations improve accuracy

# Final Guiding Principle

This diagnostic should answer one question only:

“How does this user fail under GRE-like pressure, and what must we fix first?”
